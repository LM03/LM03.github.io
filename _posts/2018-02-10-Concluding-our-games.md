    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to work out all sorts of very complicated code and when something didn't go the way I wanted to I tried different possibilities.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I tried very hard in questioning on the codes that would help me achieve what I wanted to do and was a really hard task to do myself so had asked for a bit of guidance.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>At first I had a good go myself at sorting out the problem I had due to the feedback I got and what to improve. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did well in this lesson as it was fun playing other people’s games however tricky to solve different comprehensive things that had an impact on what people thought about my game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I listened intensively to what my teacher was saying about how to work out and solve this problem that I was getting comments about and how the game would be better if it hadn’t done this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could’ve figured out more ways of getting the right answer but with constructing different bits of code however it was very tricky and had spent the whole lesson on it and am still trying to carry it on at home as I want to find how to decipher this comprehensive issue.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could maybe have played less of a game and had focused more on mine and the different ways I could have improved it although I had spent a lot of time and effort in the lesson doing this so I could’ve maybe thought of a less complicated code in this amount of time but was a very problematic task.</td>
