  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To log in to github and look at some good colour schemes that we could use to improve our websites. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve our blogs and get better colour schemes if it wasn't looking too good.For example if the text wasn't showing up over the background.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I found some good colour schemes which were very effective and nicely presented to fit with my background image.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't stop looking for different colour schemes to fit my background well as I was determined to get the right ones so it looked a nice professional front page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was asking questions on how to make it even better so that it could look really nice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I got on with my work searching for all sorts of different colours without asking how to copy the code or ask anything to do which would give you a little prompting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did very well in the task that he set us and would be more than ok to do it again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was focused throughout the lesson which didn't lead to me asking silly questions that the teacher had already explained.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One thing that I couldâ€™ve done which could've made my website look even better was to take the extra step by putting a table where my writing would go so it looked more organised.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Be more intrigued to know more about how to fit a table around my text,although I tried very hard to by myself maybe I would next time ask more questions to help guide my way through the problem.</td>
