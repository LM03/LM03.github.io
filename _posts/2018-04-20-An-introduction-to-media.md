    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Our teacher told us to log in and after, he gave us a chat on what people in class thought the term 'media' might mean.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a substantial definition of what the word means and where you can find it like in newspapers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I thought I had learned quite a lot in this lesson and could now definitely understand what it is and the examples of where you can find it.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We had done a bingo quiz on media and I persevered trying to complete the task which was to get a whole sheet filled with people's names and no spaces left under the questions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned a lot today as I was asking people if they had done a specific question on media to get a bingo.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I tried hard by myself and to tried completing my sheet of paper as fast as I could.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I had achieved a good amount of work that had been finished by the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried to communicate with lots of people in the room to be successful and therefore I looked very engaged in the task.</td>

    <td>I could have improved the speed of which I travelled across the room so I could’ve ticked the questions faster and and written the person’s name down, which would have represented that I’d done that question, as well when I had got back to my seat. </td>

    <td>There aren’t many things that I can see massives of improvement on however I do think I could have interpreted what people have to say about certain questions rather than asking the people that I knew of like my friends the questions that I knew they would say the answer that I was thinking of and this skill is something I maybe should’ve used more of in this lesson.</td>
