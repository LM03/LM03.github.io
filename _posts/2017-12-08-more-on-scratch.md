  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Our starting point was to be able to login onto scratch and to listen to what mr keen had to say about how to make the aliens go down.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>It was to make the aliens move down the page and move side to side.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did reach my target as I tried lots of possibilities on how to make my game better in other ways like making the shields slowly dissolve by making lots of different costumes and making them change every time the shield got hit. I already had made them go down and across the page in my spare time and had no problems so I did something else.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Well I tried very hard when trying different codes as to make parts of my game work better than it did like sometimes it glitched but I didn't get my head down and kept on trying to find the right answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>sometimes I questioned but otherwise I got on with my work and focused very hard on how to figure out the solution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I thought I was very independent as I already had done the class work all by myself and left me to do even more in class so I was ahead of the work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I'm thinking about how the lesson went and it was good, however i could’ve worked out how for the aliens to explode when hit a bit quicker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I thought I was listening very carefully to the instructions and generally didn't miss out a step because I had engaged to what he said before. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could’ve put my hand up to answer questions more as to when the teacher is telling us things about the code and then asks us a question which some people put their hand up to.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So maybe I could put my hand up more often and even if I get it the question wrong at least I know that I've tried and that I’m aware of what’s going on so I can apply the knowledge that I’ve gathered from the lesson to homework, spare time and other times when I know that there’s an option that I could do more work. </td>
