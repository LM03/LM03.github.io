  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Our starting point was to have collected all the sprites for next lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have been able to follow instructions on how to make the aliens move.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes I did reach my target by applying all the code onto my script and as a result the aliens moved.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>The code didn't work the first time so I made some adjustments in how to change it so that it would work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I put my hand up to ask why it wasn't working and how I could make it better as one bit of coding clearly wasn’t working and was useless until I found out that I was missing something or put the code in the wrong order.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Sometimes when I couldn’t get the right answer I tried to do it by myself but if something really wasn’t working I would put my hand up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I am reflecting on how the lesson went for me and trying my best to have gathered everything from it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I’d like to think I was listening as I got a lot of the work done and didn’t ask as many questions as the last lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Things that could’ve gone better are that if some bits of code that I put in my script didn’t work maybe I could have thought it through better and reread it after I put it on my page and see if it makes sense to me rather than assuming it would work and maybe try more things as another possibility could work.    </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have reacted differently if something went wrong and try to figure out why it’s not working by reading it carefully and make sure that bits of code like "change x to" are not jumbled up or have been put wrong context in.I could have improved my learning by doing what has just been said as this is one of the things that have slowed me down or have made me sort it out when I could be on the next task.  </td>
