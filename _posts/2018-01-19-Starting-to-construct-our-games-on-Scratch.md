  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Recapping all our ideas for our games and trying to have a go at building a part of the game in class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>It was to have finished a substantial part of my game or feel like I've done a lot on a particular part like getting all the right sprites and changing the backdrops from the front page to the actual game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>It was tricky but I managed to do a part of my game so I could move onto another thing in the weekend.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Having realised that we were given only two weeks on this project I was panicking at that moment in time however I thought positive and tried hard to make it as best as possible so I wouldn't look back and thought I could've tried harder..</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I sometimes asked questions in how someone could help me do this...For example like change the backdrop and for some particular objects to disappear as well but otherwise I tried hard to solve the problem and come up with the solution myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I wasn’t copying someone else and like I said before try and think to myself why isn’t it working and have a go at solving the problem and figuring out where I went wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did well in the lesson and hopefully will be on my computer doing the same thing in my spare time as I did in class for instance like adding different things to it to make it more interesting.     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Well there wasn’t really much to engage in but I did pay attention when the teacher was speaking about tips and having a go even if you get it wrong as it is tricky and challenging.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could’ve maybe been more versatile in my options on how to create a certain bit of my game in the same way but with less time spent in putting together all the individual bits of code.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Think carefully about what would be the best option and the easiest that would do the same job but less time spent so I can move on to the next thing that I need to make in my game that would make it original and effective if I had time.</td>
    <td></td>
