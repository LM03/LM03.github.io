    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To find an image on the computer via images.google.com.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have done a reverse image search and find roughly how many times it's been used.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did in the end by finding images.google.com from then on it was quite straight forward.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I tried hard finding out how to achieve this task thinking of the different possibilities on how to do a reverse image search to start with which I hadn't heard of before.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>This was our homework so I couldn’t really talk to the teacher or my family about it but I did think to myself, am I doing this right at some points.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was at home in my bedroom not getting distracted to what people at school might have said or whispered to me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought that I did well as it was my first time I’ve done a reverse image search on google images and worked out  well in the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>There was nothing to engage really as my teacher had just said that this was my homework and I worked it out in the end.</td>

    <td>It took me a little amount of time to do this work so maybe I could researched more things on google images to see what other results came up.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>I could have improved my learning by checking other images not just one to see the difference between them and compare how many times they’ve been used.</td>
