    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had already made our plan on our games so we were to carry on in making them from last lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I would have made progress in my game and started to make more variables and make it function better</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did however there were some challenges that I faced which made me tackle the problem in a different way.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I tried hard not to get annoyed or upset when things were going wrong like my computer freezing or some pieces of code not being correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I tried asking how to make the football glide as I had spent a lot of time on it and was still not working.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I tried to come up with a unique game, trying to add more sprites so it would look better and did not copy anyone else.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I could've maybe worked more efficiently an had done a bit more but then again I did have some technical errors with my computer which lead to me moving to another one which wasn’t my fault. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I did my best in taking in all of the advise that the teacher gave us and think I have shown it in the last few weeks.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could’ve made more of the right code and thought through it carefully and what was going to make it work but alternatively what didn’t make it work so that I could spot it as well as change it swiftly.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I may need to think of more complex code so I could show my IT skills even better than I did, although baring in mind that we only had a limited amount of time.
Due to the fact that my computer was very slow in that I had to change over to a different one halfway through the lesson maybe I need to spot that earlier so that I don’t waste crucial time on my game.</td>
