  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We were called to come over to the front of the class where we were shown an interesting video to help us understand what circumstances happen on media.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To know how to deal with certain problems and how to use social media responsibly without posting inappropriate or hurtful images.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I think so as we had learnt about the consequences of not using it in the right ways and what to do if at any point something like this does occur.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged as for when we were sat down all quietly and I didn’t disrupt the class or get distracted and was therefore fixated on the board to what was going to happen next.</td>

    <td>I couldn’t have improved massively as to how we were just listening to a video however I could’ve maybe asked a few more questions despite not having much time between the videos.</td>
