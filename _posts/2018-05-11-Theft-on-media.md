  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had listened and paid attention a lot and barely got distracted in the lesson as it was interesting and fun as to how it was so engaging by the teacher asking us questions to which we responded to by saying if we agreed or disagreed.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have asked more questions to show that I was thinking of more ideas than was expected of me so that it looked as though I was even more engaged than I was and more independent of what I was thinking and then sharing it with the class.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Ask more questions and try and be more flexible in the choices I made like thinking through them more carefully and thoroughly so that I was positive that this was the decision that I felt strongly about.</td>
