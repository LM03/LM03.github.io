  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>To have logged onto my computer quickly and to have clicked on to the link that was displayed on Google Classroom.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have worked hard and tried to achieve as much as you could by using the three different stages, Maze, Turtle, Pond. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I thought I tried very hard in putting different bits of code in certain places to receive a positive outcome and at some points was moving quite swiftly  through the different stages.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I kept on trying when things got tough in the last stages of turtle as it was challenging at first but then thought through the actual methodology and then had a go at solving the level. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't ask many questions as I was very determined to get to the end of a particular stage as I wanted to move on so I could see what the next problem was that I needed to solve. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I didn’t ask for much help, just got on with the task that was set and although was maybe hard at times but I found it fun.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I had a good go at using this interesting web for the first time and was challenging but fun at times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very focused in the lesson and did not talk to much as I wanted to complete a level that was occasionally really annoying me but nowhere near enough to making me skip it. </td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I’m not too sure if there were any major things that could’ve gone better in my learning but maybe to think in more detail about the codes I was putting down on the page.</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I’m not really sure if there were any major things I could’ve improved on massively in my learning as the task was pretty straight forward however I could have typed a little faster. </td>
