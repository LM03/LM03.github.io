    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't question very much as we were just supposed to play their game and say what you liked and didn’t.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I didn’t speak much about their or each other’s games as I was focused on getting the evaluation done as quick as I could so I was ready to swap with another person again.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did well and didn’t get distracted or hesitant in what we were doing which was good.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried to be interactive with people and generally tried to make good comments about people’s work.</td>

    <td>I’m not sure if there were any things I could’ve done better in this lesson however I could have maybe prepared even more on my game so it would look better to the people playing and watching the game but otherwise it was just playing them and writing what you liked/didn’t and then giving them a bit of feedback. </td>
