    <td>To make a clear explanation on google docs of what your game is about and how to play.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have had an idea on what your game is going to be about and to have made a planning sheet.

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I tried hard making good decisions on how my game would be addictive and fun to play like adding celebrations and other cool things.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't ask many questions in this lesson as it was quite straight forward as you just had to put down on paper what you thought was going to be a good game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I wasn’t looking over other people’s work and tried to think of something that I liked.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I was very focused and came up with a fun planning sheet of what my game is going to be.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was trying my best to be listening to the teacher and what he had to say and was busy thinking of all the possibilities of sprites I could put in my game like he said.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was quite slow in starting fill the sheet in as I thought we were supposed to have a first go at building our games to start with as we filled another sheet last week but eventually got there in the end.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>Maybe I could’ve checked with the teacher what we were going to do first so that I didn’t try and do something before I did something else. </td>
