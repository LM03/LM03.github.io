  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had to log onto the website LightBot and wait for further instructions on what we were going to be doing for the next hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>It was a mini test where we had to complete as many levels as we could on LightBot and then record them down onto our google classroom at the end so our teacher could see our progress.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I had reached a good amount of levels on the coding website and was overall a fun lesson to participate in.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>It was hard using all the repeat buttons and getting past some trickier levels but tried hard and managed it in the end.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>You couldn't really ask any questions as we were doing a test which was giving feedback to our teacher on how good we are at coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was focusing hard on my own work as I wanted to achieve the best I could for this test as I wanted to get a mark which is right for me and am happy with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I thought I did well in this lesson however I am annoyed how I spent a lot of time on one level and couldn’t complete it when at home I tried again with different code,in two minutes and it worked straight away!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had listened alot about coding in previous lessons so that helped me to engage and understand what we had to do to get a good grade.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My understanding of the repeat button of procedures was confusing at first and therefore took a bit of a long time trying to work out how to include it in my coding a little faster so that I don’t waste crucial time on working on another level.  </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work more efficiently and maybe work on how to put in different procedures in my code so I get my answer quicker when I’m doing a test but otherwise I thought it went well.</td>
